## Overview

The purpose of VSell was to create a selling and buying platform that was for students at Vanderbilt only. An authentication system was implemented to only allow valid Vanderbilt emails to sign up. A system to browse the marketplace as a guest was also created to view anonymously

## The Problem

The current system used an outdated groupme which came with its various problems. VSell was created to fix the issues the groupme had, primarily item search, limited users, and marketplace showcase.

## Main Features
**Item Search**

To prevent the need of asking the group chat if anyone was selling a specific item, the user can just search above for the item and all listing with the keyword would appear.

**Unlimited Users**

The old groupme has a member limit of 500 users and in a campus with over 7,500 students a large number of students were unable to even access the groupme.

**Marketplace Showcase**

A well designed UI that shows up to 24 items per page allows the user to see whats new on the market instead of scrolling on a group chat that only shows 3 items at once

**Bot Protection**

A secure authentication system prevents the use of bots as the old groupme was flooded with them. If the user came across an account misusing the platform, a report feature is present.

**Technology**

React, Vite, Chakra, Firebase, Firestore, NodeJS, Vercel
